# Updates

OpenUsage keeps itself up to date using [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org), the standard update
framework for Mac apps. Updates are downloaded from OpenUsage's own release feed and verified before
they install, so you always get a genuine, unmodified build.

## How it works

- **Automatic checks.** The app quietly checks for a new version in the background (about once an hour).
  When one is found, an **Update Available** banner appears at the top of the popover instead of a
  window popping up behind your other apps. Click **Install Update** to open the update window (release
  notes, download, install) front and center. The banner's close button snoozes it; it comes back the
  next time the app finds the update.
- **Manual check.** Open **Settings → Updates** and click **Check for Updates…** at any time.
  For both manual checks and banner installs, OpenUsage brings itself to the foreground before opening
  Sparkle so the update window doesn't get buried behind another app. Because OpenUsage normally lives
  only in the menu bar, it briefly shows a Dock icon for the update session, then hides again.
- **Turn it off.** The **Update Automatically** switch in **Settings → Updates** stops the
  background checks. You can still check manually.

## Beta updates

**Settings → Updates → Beta Updates** opts you into pre-release builds before they ship to
everyone. Turn it off to go back to stable-only; you'll stay on your current version until the next
stable release catches up.

Everyone always receives stable releases — the beta option only *adds* pre-release builds on top.

## Where updates come from

Update builds are published on OpenUsage's GitHub releases, and the list of available versions (the
"appcast") is served from `https://robinebers.github.io/openusage/appcast.xml`. Each download is
signed two ways — Apple notarization plus OpenUsage's own signature — and the app refuses anything that
doesn't match. This is only available in the official signed release build, not in local developer
builds.
