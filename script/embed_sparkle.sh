# Embeds Sparkle.framework into an already-staged .app bundle and signs it.
#
# SwiftPM resolves Sparkle as a binary xcframework under .build/artifacts and links the executable
# against it via @rpath, but it does NOT copy the framework into the app bundle the way Xcode would.
# A hand-built bundle therefore has to: copy the framework into Contents/Frameworks, add the runtime
# search path so the binary finds it there, and code-sign the framework (the caller signs the outer
# app bundle afterwards, WITHOUT --deep, so this signature is preserved).
#
# Usage: embed_sparkle.sh <app_bundle> <app_binary> [signing_identity] [extra_codesign_flags]
#   signing_identity      exact identity name/hash, or empty for ad-hoc ("-")
#   extra_codesign_flags  e.g. "--options runtime --timestamp" (word-split on purpose)
