/// used when present; when pi logs a `$0` cost (subscription usage it doesn't impute), the tokens are
/// priced through the shared engine instead — the same `carried cost, else price` rule the Claude and

/// nested `usage.cost.total`), so it has its own parser rather than routing through those scanners.

/// Application Support, so refreshes and relaunches parse only changed session files. A single shared
/// instance is used by every consuming provider, so pi's logs are parsed once rather than once per card.
