/// is short and where to change it. It appears only while `OnboardingStore.isCustomizeHintPending` is
/// set — marked by the seeder on a fresh install, so existing installs never see it — and goes away
/// for good only on its close button. Visiting Customize deliberately does NOT dismiss it: a quick
/// look around shouldn't cost a new user the pointer.

/// A grouped content card (`cardSurface`), not chrome: it scrolls with the provider sections and uses
/// the same surface they do.
