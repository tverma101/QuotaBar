/// - `notSet`: no key in the environment or the saved file — the card offers an Add field.

///   override checkbox.
/// - `saved`: a key was saved via the app (written to the config file) and no env key is present —
///   shown as "Saved in App", with reveal and clear controls in Edit mode.
/// - `overrideActive`: a saved key is overriding a key also present in the environment — shown as
///   "Custom Key", with reveal and clear controls (clearing falls back to the environment key).

/// The auth store's existing precedence (config file > env) is what makes a saved key an override
/// for free; this type just reports which combination is present.
