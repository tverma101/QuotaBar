/// A provider that never returns — a subprocess that doesn't exit, a credential read that blocks — used
/// to hold the store's in-flight entry forever, so the dashboard spinner turned for the rest of the
/// session. The refresh therefore runs in its own task: when the deadline wins we cancel that task and
/// stop waiting for it. Structured concurrency can't do this — a `TaskGroup` still waits for a child
/// that ignores cancellation, which is exactly the case being bounded.
///
/// Cancelling the refresh is best-effort (it only lands where the provider's own work is
/// cancellation-aware). What the deadline guarantees is that the *store* stops waiting.
